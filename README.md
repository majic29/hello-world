My name is Danario Sloan, and I like tacos and burritos.
I enjoy watching football and playing fantasy football.
I am eager to learn coding, or programming, what ever the technical term is.
As much as he has demoralized my team over the years, Tom Brady is the greatest QB of all time.
Buffalo wings and steak are delicious as well.
